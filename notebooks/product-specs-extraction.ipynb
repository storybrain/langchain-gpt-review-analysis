    "## Extracting Product Specifications using LangChain and GPT\n",
    "\n",
    "You might have interacted with langchain and OpenAI. But have you ever wished for the capability to extract specific information from a vast product description? Today, we'll discuss how to extract product specifications from textual descriptions using LangChain, a powerful framework tailored for applications driven by language models like GPT.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this session, we'll harness the potential of GPT and LangChain to meticulously extract product specifications from textual descriptions, especially focusing on:\n",
    "- **Setting Up**: Getting OpenAI key and integrating it with your Workspace.\n",
    "- **LangChain Installation**: We'll dive into the installation process of the LangChain package.\n",
    "- **Extraction Chain**: We'll explore the LangChain framework and its components.\n",
    "- **Schema**: We'll create a schema for the product specifications we want to extract.\n",
    "- **Extracting Data**: The climax of our journey â€” extracting product specifications from the textual descriptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this session, you'll be equipped with the knowledge and tools needed to extract product specifications seamlessly.\n"
